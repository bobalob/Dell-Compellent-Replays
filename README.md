# Dell-Compellent-Replays
Mount a Dell compellent replay to a given server

These scripts require the Dell Compellent Powershell Module which can be downloaded with a Dell CoPilot account at the following location:

https://kc.compellent.com/Pages/Download.aspx?DocID=2835 

The zip file needs to be manually "unblocked" (right-click, unblock) and then extracted.

The ConnectDellCompellent.PS1 script currently needs to be manually edited to add the location of the extracted Dell Compellent PS Module.
